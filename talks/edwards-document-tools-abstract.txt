Modern computational tools allow efficient generation of scientific documents by
teams of analysts. The programming language R is widely used in DFO for making
calculations and generating figures for stock assessments. The R package
RMarkdown is used to generate dynamic reports from the calculations. And Git and
GitHub allow collaborators to easily share and update their code. Two recent
examples from Pacific Region are the annual Pacific Hake stock assessment and a
synopsis of the data on 113 species of groundfish in British
Columbia. Advantages of using the modern tools are reproducibility, efficiency
(given the short time between receiving data and submitting the hake
assessment, and the need to generate the same figures for all 113 species of
groundfish), and consistency (the hake advice is presented in a consistent
manner from year to year, and the groundfish data are consistent between species).

The key to dynamic report generation is that instead of writing
"The probability of being in the healthy zone is 0.75", the analyst has code
that says "The probability of being in the healthy zone is `r prob.healthy`". The
R variable 'prob.healthy' is the result of model calculations in R, but when the calculations
are updated (say, with new data) and the value of 'prob.healthy' changes, the
text will automatically be updated and be correct. This concept extends to
figures and tables. Such automatic generation avoids time-consuming and
error-prone manual copy-and-pasting. For stock summaries, it is proposed that an
R package be created to automatically read in results and produce a
standard stock summary, including text, figures and tables in English and
French.
